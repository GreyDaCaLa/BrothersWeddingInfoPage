        This will depend on the dates you are planning on staying. To get to the
        Dominican Republic typically takes 2 flights to get there depending from
        where you are departing. But it will not take you a whole day unless you
        choose long layovers. The 3 airports that we recommend are below,
        starting with the closest to Dreams Macao. However, make sure you look
        up the distance from the resort you are staying at to the closest
        airport. Also, when booking your hotel sometimes they might offer pick
        up and drop off to the airport at an extra fee, usually pretty doable.
