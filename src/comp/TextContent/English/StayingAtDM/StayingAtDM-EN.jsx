      <div className="Self_TextBody">
        Since we are part of a vacation club the resort allows us to send
        referrals to others in order for them to sell their vacation packages to
        new guests. If you choose to go with this option we would provide your
        information to the vacation club representatives and will contact you to
        organize your stay in return for you to sit through a <strong>1 hour
        presentation</strong>. This is very similar to a timeshare presentation. You are
         <strong> NOT obligated</strong> to buy anything but if you do go with this option and sit
        through the presentation they will provide you with a discount on your
        stay. They will also <strong>allow you to put down as little as $350 to confirm </strong>
        your reservation and give you the ability to <strong>pay the rest of the balance
        up to 45 days prior to checking in</strong>. Any other option will require you to
        pay your balance in full upon making the reservation. If you want to
        save some money and donâ€™t mind spending part of your day in a
        presentation then this can be a good option If you want to stay at
        Dreams Macao. Please be aware that we can only send out 10 referrals and
        will be doing it on a first come first serve basis. If you are
        interested in this option please contact Gregorio.
